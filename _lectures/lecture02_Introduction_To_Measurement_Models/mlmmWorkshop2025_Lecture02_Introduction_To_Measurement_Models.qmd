## Section Objectives

1. Latent traits
2. Our first graphical model (path diagram)
3. Psychometric models from generalized linear models



## Latent Traits: A Big-Picture View

Latent trait theory posits there are attributes of a person (typically) that are:

::: {.nonincremental} 
* Unobservable (hence the term latent)
* Quantifiable 
* Related to tasks that can be observed
::: 

Often, these attributes are often called constructs, underscoring they are constructed and do not exist, such as:

::: {.nonincremental} 
* A general or specific ability (in educational contexts)
* A feature of personality, such as "extroversion" (in psychological contexts)
::: 

The same psychometric models apply regardless of the measurement context



## Latent Traits are Interdisciplinary

* Many varying fields use some version of latent traits
* Similar (or identical) methods are often developed separately
  * Item response theory in education
  * Item factor analysis in psychology
* Many different terms for same ideas, such as the 
  * Label given to the latent trait: Factor/Ability/Attribute/Construct
  * Label given to those giving the data: Examinee/Subject/Participant/Respondent/Patient/Student
* What this means:
  * Lots of words to keep track of, but (relatively) few concepts
  * We will focus on concepts (but have a lot of words)



## Best Measures are Built Purposefully

* Latent constructs seldom occur randomly---they are defined 
  * The definition typically indicates:
    * What the construct means
    * What observable behaviors are likely related to the construct
      * For a lot of what we do, observable behavior means answering questions on an assessment or survey
* Therefore, modern psychometric methods are built around specifying the set of observed variables to which a latent variable relates 
  * <u>No need for exploratory analyses---we define our construct and seek to falsify our definition</u>
* The term I use for "relates" is "measure"
  * e.g., Educational assessment items measure some type of ability



## Guiding Principles

* To better understand psychometric methods and theory, envision what analyses would be used if latent variables were not latent
  * Example: Imagine if we could directly observe mathematics ability 
* Then, consider what we would do with that value
  * Example: We could predict how students would perform on items using logistic regression (with $\theta$ as an observed predictor)
* Psychometric models essentially do this---use observed variable methods as if we know the value of the latent variable
  * But, with:
    * A data collection design allowing for such methods to be used
    * A more formal vetting of whether or not we did a good job measuring the construct



## Measurement of Latent Constructs

How does this process differ when we cannot observe the thing we are measuring---when the construct is latent?

  * We still need something we can observe---item responses for example
  * We need a method to map the response to a number (Strongly agree==5?)
  * We also need a way to aggregate all responses to a value that represents a person
    * A score or classification
  * We then need a way to ensure what we just did means what we think it does
    * Methods for validation
  * We also need to remember that the values we estimate for a person's latent trait(s) won't be perfectly reliable  
    * Caution needed for secondary analyses
  



## Measurement Models

* A distinguishing feature of psychometric models is the second word---they are models
  * We often call such models "measurement models"
* Measurement models are <u>the mathematical specification that provides the link between the latent variable(s) and the observed data</u>
* The form of such models looks different across the wide classes of measurement models (e.g., factor analysis vs. item response models) but wide generalities exist
* Measurement models need:
  * Distributional assumptions about the data (with link functions)
  * A linear or non-linear form that predicts data from the trait(s)
* The key: Observed data are being predicted by latent variable(s)



## Measurement Models vs. Other Measurement Techniques

Measurement models are a different way of thinking about psychometrics than what most people without psychometric training do

* Most scientists enumerate item response scores (e.g., correct response == 1; strongly agree == 5)
* The latent trait score estimate is then formed by adding the response scores together 
  * "Add "Stuff" Up" model: Ask Lesa what "stuff" means here...(Scheiße zusammenzählen?)
* As it turns out, the naïve adding together of item scores implies a measurement model
  * Called parallel items --- very strict assumptions (equal variances and covariances for all observed variables)



## Characteristics of Latent Variables
  
Latent variables can be defined to have different levels of measurement

  * Interval level (as in factor analysis and item response theory) --- Continuous
    * No absolute zero; units of the factor are equivalent across the range of values
    * Example: A person with a value of 2 is the same distance from a person with a value of 0 as is a person with a value of -2
  * Ordinal level (as in diagnostic classification models)
    * Can rank order people but not determine how far apart they may be
    * Example: Students considered masters of a topic have more ability than students considered non-masters
  * Nominal level (as in latent class or finite mixture models) --- Categorical
    * Groups/classes/clusters of people



    
## Most Common: Continuous Latents

* For most of this workshop, we will treat latent variables as continuous (interval level)
* As they do not exist, continuous latent variables need a defined metric:
  * What is their mean?
  * What is their standard deviation?
* Defining the metric is the first step in a latent variable model
  * Called scale identification
* The metric is arbitrary
  * Can set differing means/variances but still have same model
  * Linear transformations of parameters based on scale mean and standard deviation




## Measurement Model Path Diagrams

Measurement models are often depicted in graphical format, using what is called a path diagram

::: {.nonincremental} 
* Typically, latent variables are represented as objects that are circles/ovals
* Using graph theory terms, a variable in a path diagram (latent or observed) is called a node
* Lines connecting the variables are called edges
:::



## Latent Variable Only


```{r firstLatent}
wall()

latentVariable = latent("Latent Variable", rx= .2, ry=.2)
draw(latentVariable)
```





## Adding Observed Variables

Measurement model path diagrams often denote observed variables with rectangular boxes

On the next slide:

* The term "latent variable" is replaced with $\theta$
* The observed variables are denoted as $Y1$ through $Y5$ 
  * Imagine these represent five observed items of a scale measuring $\theta$




## Path Diagram with Observed and Latent Variables


```{r ObsLatent}

wall(ylim=c(.2,1))

latentVariable = latent(expression(theta), rx= .12, ry=.12, x=.8, y = .6)
draw(latentVariable)
obsVariables = list()
for (var in 1:5){
  obsVariables[[paste0("Y", var)]] = manifest(paste0("Y", var), x = .2 , y=.9-(var-1)*.15)
  draw(obsVariables[[paste0("Y", var)]])
  arrow(from=latentVariable, to = obsVariables[[paste0("Y", var)]], start = "west", end="east")
}

```




## Path Diagrams: Not Models

Path diagrams are useful for depicting a measurement model but are not isomorphic with the mathematical models they depict

* All model parameters are often not included in the diagram
* No indication about the distribution of the variables




## Translating a Path Diagram to a Model

Going back to the point from before---let's imagine the latent variable as an observed variable

::: {.nonincremental} 
* An arrow (edge) indicates one variable predicts another
  * The predictor is the variable on the side of the arrow without the point
  * The outcome is the variable on the side of the point
* If we assume the items were continuous (like linear regression), the diagram indicates a regression model for each outcome
:::

$$
\begin{array}{c}
Y_{p1} = \beta_{Y_1, 0} + \beta_{Y_1,1} \theta_p + e_{p, Y_1} \\ 
\end{array}
$$



## Interpreting the Parameters

All five regression lines implied by the model are then:
$$
\begin{array}{c}
Y_{p1} = \beta_{Y_1, 0} + \beta_{Y_1,1} \theta_p + e_{p, Y_1} \\ 
Y_{p1} = \beta_{Y_2, 0} + \beta_{Y_2,1} \theta_p + e_{p, Y_2} \\ 
Y_{p3} = \beta_{Y_3, 0} + \beta_{Y_3,1} \theta_p + e_{p, Y_3} \\ 
Y_{p4} = \beta_{Y_4, 0} + \beta_{Y_4,1} \theta_p + e_{p, Y_4} \\ 
Y_{p5} = \beta_{Y_5, 0} + \beta_{Y_5,1} \theta_p + e_{p, Y_5} \\ 
\end{array}
$$

Here:

::: {.nonincremental} 
* $\beta_{Y_i, 0}$ is the intercept of the regression line predicting the score from item $Y_i$
  * The expected resposne score for a person who has $\theta_p=0$
* $\beta_{Y_i, 1}$ is the slope of the regression line predicting the score from item $Y_i$
  * The expected change in the response score for a one-unit change in $\theta_p$
:::



## More Interpreting the Parameters

Also:

::: {.nonincremental} 
* $e_{p, Y_i}$ is the residual (error), indicating the difference in the predicted score for person $p$ to item $i$
  * Like in regression, we additionally assume:
    * $e_{p,Y_i} \sim N\left(0, \sigma^2_{e_{Y_i}} \right)$: is normally distributed with mean zero
* $\sigma^2_{e_{Y_i}}$ is the residual variance of item $Y_i$, indicating the square of how far off the prediction is on average
:::

The five regression models are estimated simultaneously:

::: {.nonincremental} 
* If $\theta_p$ were observed, we would call this a multivariate regression
  * <u>Multivariate regression</u>: Multiple continuous outcomes predicted by one or more predictors
:::



## More About Regression

$$Y_{pi} = \beta_{Y_i, 0} + \beta_{Y_i,1} \theta_p + e_{p, Y_i} $$
In the regression model for a single variable, what distribution do we assume about the outcome?

* As error is normally distributed, the outcome takes a normal distribution $Y_{pi} \sim N( ?, ?)$
* As $\beta_{Y_i, 0}$, $\beta_{Y_i,1}$, and $\theta_p$ are constants, they move the mean of the outcome to $\beta_{Y_i, 0} + \beta_{Y_i,1} \theta_p$
  * $Y_{pi} \sim N( \beta_{Y_i, 0} + \beta_{Y_i,1} \theta_p, ?)$
* As error has a variance of $\sigma^2_{e_{Y_i}}$, the outcome is assumed to have variance $\sigma^2_{e_{Y_i}}$
  * $Y_{pi} \sim N( \beta_{Y_i, 0} + \beta_{Y_i,1} \theta_p, \sigma^2_{e_{Y_i}})$
* Therefore, we say $Y_{pi}$ follows a conditionally normal distribution



## The Univariate Normal Distribution

$Y \sim N( \mu, \sigma^2)$ that implies a probability density function (pdf)

 $$f\left(Y\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2 }}\exp\left[\frac{\left(Y - \mu \right)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right]$$

* Here, $\pi$ is the constant 3.14 and $\exp$ is Euler's constant (2.71)
* Of note here is that there are three components that go into the function:
  * The data $Y$
  * The mean $\mu$ --- this can be the conditional mean we had on the previous slide (formed by parameters)
  * The variance $\sigma^2$
* <u>The key to using Bayesian methods is to know the distributions for each of the variables in the model</u>



## From Regression to CFA

When $\theta_i$ is latent, the five-variable model becomes a <u>confirmatory factor analysis</u> (CFA) model 

::: {.nonincremental} 
* <u>CFA</u>: Prediction of continuous items using linear regression with one or more continuous latent variables as predictors
  * The interpretations of the regression parameters are identical between linear regression and CFA
::: 



## Regression and CFA Differences 

The differences between CFA and regression are:

::: {.nonincremental} 
* $\theta_p$ as a predictor is not observed in CFA but is observed in regression
  * Therefore, we must set its mean and variance
    * There are multiple was to do this (standardized factor, marker item, etc...)---stay tuned
* Each of the model parameters has a different name (and symbol denoting it) in CFA
  * $\beta_{Y_i, 0} = \mu_i$  is the item intercept
  * $\beta_{Y_i,1} = \lambda_i$ is the factor loading for an item
  * $\sigma^2_{e_{Y_i}} = \psi^2_i$ is the unique variance for an item
* We must have a sufficient number of observed variables to empirically identify the latent trait
::: 



## Changing Notation

Our five-item CFA model with CFA-notation:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
Y_{p1} = \mu_1 + \lambda_1 \theta_p + e_{p, Y_1} \\ 
Y_{p2} = \mu_2 + \lambda_2 \theta_p  + e_{p, Y_2} \\ 
Y_{p3} = \mu_3 + \lambda_3 \theta_p  + e_{p, Y_3} \\ 
Y_{p4} = \mu_4 + \lambda_4 \theta_p  + e_{p, Y_4} \\ 
Y_{p5} = \mu_5 + \lambda_5 \theta_p  + e_{p, Y_5} \\ 
\end{array}
$$




## Measurement Models for Different Item Types

* The CFA model assumes (1) continuous latent variables and (2) continuous item scores
  * What should we do if we have binary items (e.g., yes/no, correct/incorrect)?
* If we had observed $\theta_p$ and wanted to predict $Y_{1p} \in \{0,1\}$  what type of analysis would we use?
* Logistic regression: 
  $$P\left(Y_{p1} = 1\right) = \frac{\exp \left( \beta_{Y_1,0} + \beta_{Y_1,1} \theta_p\right)}{1+\exp \left( \beta_{Y_1,0} + \beta_{Y_1,1} \theta_p\right)}$$  




## Interpreting Model Parameters

$$Logit \left( P\left(Y_{p1} = 1\right) \right) = \beta_{Y_1,0} + \beta_{Y_1,1} \theta_p$$

Here:

- $\beta_{Y_1,0}$ is the intercept --- the expected log odds of a correct response when $\theta_p = 0$
- $\beta_{Y_1,1}$ is the slope --- the expected change in log odds of a correct response for a one-unit change in $\theta_p$
- Note: there is no error variance term




## Bernoulli Distributions

* Using logistic regression for binary outcomes makes the assumption that the outcome follows a (conditional) Bernoulli distribution, or $Y \sim B(p_Y)$
  * The parameter $p_Y$ is the probability that Y equals one, or $P\left(Y = 1\right)$
* The Bernoulli pdf (sometimes called the probability mass function as the variable is discrete) is: $$f(Y) = \left(p_Y\right)^Y \left(1-p_Y \right)^{1-Y}$$
* So, there is no error variance parameter in logistic regression as there is no parameter in the distribution that represents error (it is a non-constant function of the mean)
  * Error is represented by how far off a probability is from either zero or one



## Logistic Regression with Latent Variable(s)


* Back to our running example, if we had binary items and wished to form a (unidimensional) latent variable model, we would have something that looked like: 

$$P\left(Y_{pi} = 1 \mid \theta_p \right) = \frac{\exp \left( \mu_i + \lambda_i \theta_p\right)}{1+\exp \left( \mu_i + \lambda_i \theta_p\right)}$$  




## Logistic Regression with Latent Variable(s)

$$P\left(Y_{pi} = 1 \mid \theta_p \right) = \frac{\exp \left( \mu_i + \lambda_i \theta_p\right)}{1+\exp \left( \mu_i + \lambda_i \theta_p\right)}$$  

* Here, the parameters retain their names from CFA:
  * $\beta_{Y_i, 0} = \mu_i$  is the item intercept
  * $\beta_{Y_i,1} = \lambda_i$ is the factor loading for an item
* We call this slope-intercept parameterization
* This parameterization is called <u>item factor analysis(IFA)</u> 
  * Sometimes the intercept $\mu_i$ is replaced with a threshold $\tau$ (where $\tau = -\mu_i$)




## From IFA to IRT

* IFA and IRT are equivalent models---their parameters are transformations of each other:
$$ 
\begin{array}{c}
a_i = \lambda_i \\
b_i = -\frac{\mu_i}{\lambda_i}
\end{array}
$$



## More Comparisons

![Comparing IFA and IRT (Source: Lesa Hoffman)](img/lesaslide.png)



## From IFA to IRT

* This yields the discrimination difficulty parameterization that is common in unidimensional IRT models:

$$P\left(Y_{pi} = 1 \mid \theta_p \right) = \frac{\exp \left( a_i\left( \theta_p -b_i\right)\right)}{1+\exp \left(a_i\left( \theta_p -b_i\right)\right)}$$

* Here:,
  * $b_i$ is the item difficulty---the point on the $\theta$ scale at which a person has a 50% chance of answering with a one
  * $a_i$ is the item discrimination---the slope of a line tangent to the curve at the item difficulty
* IRT models have a number of different forms of this equation (this is the two-parameter logistic 2PL model)



## IRT Example: Acheivement Data

To demonstrate a couple IRT models, we will compare a 1PL and 2PL model for the example data

## Generalized Linear (Psychometric) Models: Summary

* A key to understanding the varying types of psychometric models is that they must map the theory (the right-hand side of the equation---$\theta_p$) to the type of observed data (left-hand side of the equation)
* So far we've seen two types of data: continuous (with a normal distribution) and binary (with a Bernoulli distribution)
* For each, the right-hand side of the item model was the same
* For the normal distribution:
  * We had an error term but did not transform the right-hand side
* For the Bernoulli distribution:
  * No error term and a function used to transform the right-hand side so that the conditional mean will range between zero and one
